<p>
				☛ Varanasi (Vārāṇasī; [ʋaːˈraːɳəsi]) is a city on the Ganges river in northern India that has a central place in pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu world,[10][11][12] even as the traditions are transformed in the face of modernization, generational changes and emigration.[13][14] The city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its tourism..<br><br>
				☛ The name Varanasi was officially so revived after 1947,[17] but the city is still widely known by its earlier name Banaras or Benares (Banāras; [bəˈnaːrəs] (listen)),[18][19] and its ancient name Kashi.[20][21] Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river. It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of India's capital New Delhi, 320 kilometres (200 mi) south-east of the state capital, Lucknow, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) east of Allahabad (officially Prayagraj), where upstream on Ganges the confluence with the Yamuna river is another Hindu pilgrimage site. .<br><br>
				☛ Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities.[22] Kashi, its ancient name, was associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby Sarnath has been interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth century BCE.[23][24] In the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. Since ancient times, the city has been an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry contributing to its cultural importance.[25] Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas.[26] In the 16th century, Rajput nobles in the service of the courts and armies of the Mughal emperor Akbar, sponsored the building or further enhancement of the major Shiva temple in the city.<br><br>
				☛ IAccording to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva,[37] one of three principal deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.[38]
				<br><br> ☛ Tourism is Varanasi's second most important industry.[142] Domestic tourist most commonly visit for religious purposes while foreign tourist visit for ghats along River Ganges and Sarnath. Most domestic tourists are from Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and other parts of Uttar Pradesh, while the majority of foreign tourists are from Sri Lanka and Japan.[143] The peak tourist season falls between October and March.[143] In total, there are around 12,000 beds available in the city, of which about one half are in inexpensive budget hotels and one third in dharamsalas.[144] Overall, Varanasi's tourist infrastructure is not well developed”</strong>

				<br><br> ☛ The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, on the Ganges, is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga Shiva temples in Varanasi.[160] The temple has been destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout its existence. The Gyanvapi Mosque, which is adjacent to the temple, is the original site of the temple.[161] The temple, which is also known as the Golden Temple,[162] was built in 1780 by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore. The two pinnacles of the temple are covered in gold and were donated in 1839 by Ranjit Singh, the ruler of Punjab. The dome is scheduled to receive gold plating through a proposed initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs of Uttar Pradesh. Numerous rituals, prayers, and aartis are held daily at the temple between 02:30 and 23:00.[163]
